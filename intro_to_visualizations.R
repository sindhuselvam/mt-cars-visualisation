mtcars #mtcars is an inbuilt dataset in R 
View(mtcars) # viewing the dataset to get an idea of what is there inside the dataset
dim(mtcars)
names(mtcars) #gives the names of the columns
head(mtcars) # you can use either head or View function to see the contents of the dataset, viewfn will give a complete view of the data set whereas head fn will show only the first five rows of the data set 
tail(mtcars) # gives you the last 6 rows of the data set
summary(mtcars)# gives descriptive statistics(min, 1st Q, Median, Mean, 3rd Q, max))

# mode is not a built-in R function, we calculate it for each using mode()

str(mtcars) #structure of the data set

  #historgram- A histogram is an accurate representation of the distribution of numerical data.
  #It is an estimate of the probability distribution of a continuous variable (quantitative variable)
  #and was first introduced by Karl Pearson.[1] It differs from a bar graph, in the sense 
  #that a bar graph relates two variables, but a histogram relates only one.

#boxplot=a simple way of representing statistical data on a plot in which a rectangle is drawn to represent 
  #the second and third quartiles, usually with a vertical line inside to indicate the median value. 
  #The lower and upper quartiles are shown as horizontal lines either side of the rectangle.
  
#boxplotting am vs MPG
